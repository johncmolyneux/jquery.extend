jquery.extend
=============

jQuery extension library.

This library extends jQuery by adding new functions that I have created.  These will be updated and listed below.

$.createEvent()
-
This function allows you to create custom events and assign event handlers to them using the default jQuery on() method.

There are custom events in the custom-events.js as examples of how to use it.
