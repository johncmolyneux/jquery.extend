jquery.extend
=============

jQuery extension library.

This library extends jQuery by adding new functions that I have created.  These will be updated and listed below.

$.createEvent()
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This function allows you to create custom events and assign event handlers to them using the default jQuery on() method.

There are custom events in the source code as examples of how to use it.  The main function to look at is $.createEvent which is used to assign event handlers to custom events that you create.
